## Implementing Lee & Preparata's shortest Euclidean path algorithm
This is a repository for our group's project for course "Numerical Methods" on presenting Lee and Preparataâ€™s algorithm for finding shortest paths in a simple polygon.
The paper that we are implementing is ["Euclidean shortest paths in the presence of rectilinear barriers" by Lee and Preparata](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Euclidean-shortest-paths-in-the-presence-of-Lee-Preparata/086cf6cb05ee77f0df9cccf8d3ec1328f0e9241f)
