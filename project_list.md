## Stuff about each proj

### 1. Phong shading 

Use OpenGl and C++, probably could easily find code.

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading) 

### 2. Convex hull 

[github](https://github.com/linhnk2109/O-Convexhull/tree/main) 

[The teacher's one](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360617315_A_fast_and_efficient_algorithm_for_determining_the_connected_orthogonal_convex_hulls)


There's 2 paper files in the repo

smth like Quickhull alg(they said)

### 3. Lee and Preparata

The original paper is in the repo

[the wrong one](https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4927&context=thesesdissertations#:~:text=The%20kernel%20of%20a%20simple,is%20the%20kernel%20of%20P.) 

### 4. Crack detection

Use python and OpenCV library

[Link in the file](https://hub.packtpub.com/opencv-detecting-edges-lines-shapes/)

The link generally has some of the codes.

### 5. YOLO crack detection

Use python and some libs

look hard i think
